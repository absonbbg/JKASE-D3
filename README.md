## How to build  
**NOTE 1: This is a DIY project. The current version of JKASE D3 is v1.0. The steps and parts are quite complicated and tedious. So please be prepared~**
 
**NOTE 2: This is my personal project. The update process is currently slow. Therefore, both the [User Manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VRi_LQBDhcZ8YW_KE0V_FxEDj4TOAPhPPbnMbp1qJXQ/edit?usp=sharing) and the [Bill of Materials](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTDV55PDLI_-VLqr5_B4HkwDLA5240rTCraWzzHT4jYiwCrdkjbFOL7cVF3HNw2yrIR6ZoA4pk6Mkd6/pubhtml?gid=1207346702&single=true) are preliminary versions and will be updated from time to time**
